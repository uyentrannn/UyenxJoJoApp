  Thank You
  For loving me true,
  For being no one but you,
  For holding my hand
  And helping me stand.

  Thank You
  For never giving up
  And never getting stuck
  In the dark times
  Where only love shines

  Thank you
  For the kind letters
  That make me feel better,
  For putting up with me,
  And loving what you see.

  Thank you
  Now and forever.
  Remember, I'll never
  Stop loving you.
  What I say is true;
  I mean it from my heart,
  Even when it's dark.
  I love you.''',
